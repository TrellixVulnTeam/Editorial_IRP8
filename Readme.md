# Editorial scripts

In this reporistory I maintain a couple of usefull Editorial Python script that (hopefully) extend the functionality of Editorial. 

[OMZ](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) states:
> Editorial is a plain text editor for iOS with great Markdown support and powerful automation tools.

## Pip

Script to mimic the `pip install` behaviour we all know and embrace. Just run `python pip.py <package_name>` to intall the package from source. Currently only pure Python packages are supported.
